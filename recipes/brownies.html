        <h3> Description:</h3>

        <p>
           <strong> A chocolate brownie </strong> or simply a <strong>brownie </strong> is a chocolate baked confection.
            Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their <em>density</em>.
            Brownies often, but not always,have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust.
            They may also include <em> nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate chips, or other ingredients</em>.
            A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a <strong>blond brownie or blondie</strong>.
            The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized there during the first half of the 20th century.

            They are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by milk, served warm with ice cream (a la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge.
            In North America, they are common homemade treats and they are also popular in restaurants and coffeehouses.

        <h3>ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs + water</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar</li>
            <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</li>
            <li>combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick.</li>
            <li>Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li>
            <li>Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. They also freeze well for up to a month. Last time I made these, I doubled the recipe and stored the second batch in the freezer. It was so fun to have them on hand for a quick and easy dessert or afternoon treat</p>
